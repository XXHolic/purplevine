[00:49.06]黑暗里 月亮落了地
[00:56.01]应该悲伤叹息 身体却没了力气
[01:03.64]因为彼此怀疑 我们漂浮在这里
[01:11.16]我们曾有引力 怎么没人记起
[01:18.1]Stay Here
[01:21.14]I want you stay with me
[01:25.72]用尽最后的空气
[01:32.72]Stay Here
[01:35.74]I want you stay with me
[01:40.74]反正也没人回应
[01:50.7]Stay Here Stay Stay
[02:03.11]Stay Stay Stay Stay Stay Stay
[02:36.25]Stay Here
[02:39.45]I want you stay with me
[02:43.82]在听不见的夜里
[02:50.54]Stay Here
[02:54.23]I want you stay with me
[02:58.89]像没人看的电影
[03:20.64]看 天空在闪
[03:26.41]来的太晚
[03:35.3]Stay Here stay with me
[03:43.29]就这样漫无目的
[03:50.68]Stay Here stay with me
[03:58.22]像坠入最深的海底
[04:05.63]Stay Here
[04:08.73]I want you stay with me
[04:13.41]向着稀薄的光明
[04:20.27]Stay Here
[04:23.41]I want you stay with me
[04:28.38]换个清白的姓名 再叫醒
